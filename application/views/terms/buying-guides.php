								<h4><b>Cake Buying Gudie</b></h4>
											
							<div class="box visible" style="display: block;">
								<p align="justify">The cakes of ancient history were more bread-like and not much like the cakes of today. The first incidence of "cake" baking is credited to the ancient Egyptians, who showed the first advanced skills in baking. However, evidence of more modern-like iced cakes dates back to the mid-17th century in Europe. Cakes from that time period are the first known cakes to be baked with sugar, but they were still different from many of the cakes of today because they used yeast in the cakes.

Historically, cakes generally contained fruits, such as raisins and currants, and the icing was made from a boiled combination of sugar, egg whites, and flavorings that were poured onto the cakes and baked into a glaze. For baking the cakes, a round mold called a cake hoop was used. These cake hoops were made from metal, wood, and even paper, and they were placed onto a flat baking sheet to bake.

It was not until the mid-19th century that refined flour began to be used in cakes and yeast was replaced with baking powder, which gave cakes a much lighter consistency. The first cake pans resembled the design of the cake hoops and appeared around the same time.</p>
